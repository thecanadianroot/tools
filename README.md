# Tools

Tools that I developed for my personal usage:

- [Docker Toolkit](docker/toolkit): A container with a web IDE (Visual Studio Code) that you can within an isolated
  environment (like a docker-compose stack or a Kubernetes cluster) to communicate with other containers while also
  being able to easily run some scripts within the web IDE. Comes with an OpenSSH server for easy integration with
  Jetbrains' tools or SSH tunneling shenanigans.
