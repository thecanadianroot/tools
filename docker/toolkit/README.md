# Toolkit
Container for development purposes with a web IDE (VSCode) and SSH access (useful with Jetbrains' tools).

**Most credits goes to [linuxserver.io](https://www.linuxserver.io/) as I've just basically merged [linuxserver/docker-code-server](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-code-server) and [linuxserver/docker-openssh-server](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-openssh-server) together and added some more developer tools on top of it.**
